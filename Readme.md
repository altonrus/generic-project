This is the generic "new project" template for the D3Mod lab at McGill. For details, see our lab manual: <https://altonrus.quarto.pub/decision-modeling-lab-manual/>.

Others are welcome to clone and adapt. Note that the .gitignore'file is set up to not push certain files to GitHub, so that you can store non-public data locally on your computer without sharing it. You will have to manually create these directories after you clone the repo if you wish to use (and of course, you are free to add any other file or directory you wish to keep off Github to .gitignore.

The private directories that won't push to GitHub are:

local

1_data/private

3_intermediate/private

4_output/private
